        Grilled BBQ short ribs are a smoky and flavorful delight, featuring tender beef ribs marinated in a rich, tangy barbecue sauce and grilled to perfection. 
        The ribs develop a beautiful char and a deep, savory taste that makes them a favorite at outdoor gatherings and family dinners. 
        Their juicy, melt-in-your-mouth texture paired with the bold barbecue glaze creates a mouthwatering experience that's hard to resist.

    <h1><b>Ingredients</b></h1>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon packed brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon paprika</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon chili powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>4 pounds beef short ribs (bone-in), trimmed of fat</li>
        <li>Reynolds Wrap® Heavy Duty Aluminum Foil</li>
        <li>½ cup barbecue sauce, plus additional for serving</li>
    </ul>

    <h1><b>Steps</b></h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix brown sugar, paprika, chili powder, salt, and garlic powder in a medium bowl.</li>
        <li>Cut ribs into equal portions. Generously rub spice mixture onto all surfaces of ribs; place ribs in a single layer in a glass baking dish. 
            Cover and refrigerator for 30 minutes to 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Preheat grill to medium indirect heat, 375 to 400 degrees F (190 to 200 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Center one portion ribs on a 12x18-inch sheet of heavy-duty aluminum foil; add 2 ice cubes. 
            Bring up the foil sides, then double-fold the top and ends to seal the packet, leaving room for heat circulation inside. 
            Repeat to make 3 more packets.</li>
        <li>Arrange packets over indirect heat on the preheated grill. Cover and cook until tender, 1 1/2 to 2 hours.</li>
        <li>Uncover the grill. Keeping the foil packets on the grill, 
            open them carefully by cutting along the top folds with a sharp knife, allowing steam to escape; then proceed to open packets fully.</li>
        <li>Brush ribs with about 1/2 cup barbecue sauce.</li>
        <li>Move packets over direct heat, cover, and continue grilling, turning once, until ribs are browned and crisp, about 5 minutes more.</li>
        <li>Serve with additional barbecue sauce as desired.</li>
    </ol>
